### Tkinter

> Tkinter is commonly bundled with Python, using Tk and is Python’s standard GUI framework. It is popular for its
> simplicity and graphical user interface. It is open source and available under the Python License.
> One of the advantages of choosing Tkinter is that since it comes by default, there is an abundance of resources, both
> codes and reference books. Also with the community being old and active, there are many users who can help you out in
> case of doubts. Here are some examples to get you started.

### Kivy

> Kivy is an OpenGL ES 2 accelerated framework for the creation of new user interfaces. It supports multiple platforms
> namely Windows, MacOSX, Linux, Android iOS and Raspberry Pi. It is open source and comes with over 20 widgets in its
> toolkit.

### WxPython

> WxPython is an open source wrapper for cross-platform GUI library WxWidgets (earlier known as WxWindows) and implemented
as a Python extension module. With WxPython you as a developer can create native applications for Windows, Mac OS and
Unix. If you’re just beginning to develop applications in WxPython, here is a good simple tutorial you can go through.

### PyQT

> PyQT is one of the favoured cross-platform Python bindings implementing the Qt library for the Qt (owned by Nokia)
> application development framework. Currently, PyQT is available for Unix/Linux, Windows, Mac OS X and Sharp Zaurus. It
> combines the best of Python and Qt and it up to the programmer to decide whether to create a program by coding or
> using
> Qt Designer to create visual dialogs. It is available in both, commercial as well as GPL license. Although some
> features
> may not be available in the free version, if your application is open source, then you can use it under the free
> license.
